Sports like table tennis, badminton, and boxing help enhance reaction time. Hand-eye coordination drills, such as juggling or catching a ball, improve responsiveness. Agility exercises like sprint starts, ladder drills, and quick direction changes boost speed and reflexes. Practicing reaction-based drills, such as partner-based reflex training, enhances quick decision-making. Additionally, maintaining a healthy lifestyle with proper sleep, nutrition, and hydration supports better neural responses. With consistent practice, reflexes can become sharper and more efficient.";
